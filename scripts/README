Following the execution of
getLatestOSM.sh that fetches the pbf files from OSM we need to process the content

execute doProcessOSM.sh with first 
'unzipRelative' 
then
'createGPKG'

move the created subdirs using moveCreated
as 'moveCreated' <target dir>

(independently where its moved to extract the subsets)

in the parent directory of files, that will create subdirectories of the shape files and GPK
they then have to be moved and consolidated for filtering items

## ensure libraries and packages needed are installed
use filterOSMAtrributes.py
in the relevant subsets

after features are subset we can exclude the ones based on geometry functions, i.e. find all within a certain distance of the coast line
